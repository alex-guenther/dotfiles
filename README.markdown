# Alexander GÃ¼nthers dotfiles

This repo is heavily inspired by https://github.com/holman/dotfiles.
But right now I don't care about Darwin. 
Instead I want to be able to automatically setup working home environments reliably and fast.

The goal is to use it in docker and accorss all machines I work on. 

Rolling this out via cdist would be also something to consider.

TODO: does this actually still make some sense? Maybe cdist or something alike is the way to go?
